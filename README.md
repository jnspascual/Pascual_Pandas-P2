**I. Intended Learning Outcomes:**

1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library

**II. Instructions:**

Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. 
You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

For this programming assignment. download the following file and save to your default user folder:

**PROBLEM 2**
Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py

Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations.

a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7 ...) of cars.

b. Display the row taht contains the 'Model' of 'Mazda RX4'.

c. How many cylinders ('cyl') does that car model 'Camaro Z28' have?
